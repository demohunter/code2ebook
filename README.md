Description
===========

Want to browse big source code trees in your Kindle or iPad?

This project provides utilities to help generating pretty ebook files in various formats
directly from arbitrary source trees.

Generate static HTML sites from source trees
--------------------------------------------

Before you begin, ensure you have installed all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) (well, don't be scared, just `vim`, `ctags`, and `perl` ;)).

### src2html.pl

The `src2html.pl` script can generate an HTML tree from the source tree that you specify, for example:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/code2ebook:$PATH

cd /path/to/your/project/
src2html.pl --color --cross-reference . 'Your Book Title'
```

The resulting HTML site can be viewed in a web browser. And the entry
point is `./index.html` (according to the command above).

The following image shows what a typical HTML page looks like when rendered by a web browser:

![minimal C source file example](http://agentzh.org/misc/image/src2html-main-c.png)

See [Samples](#samples) for more complicated real-world sample outputs.
Note that, for ebook readers lacking colors (like Amazon Kindle), then
you should not specify the `--color` option for the `src2html.pl` script.

This is essentially an HTML-formatted "ebook", which is readily browsable in
a web browser on either a PC or a tablet.

#### Usage

For the full usage of this script, specify the `-h` or `--help` options. One sample output is

```
src2html.pl [options] dir book-title

Options:
    --charset CHARSET     Specify the charset used by the HTML
                          outputs. Default to UTF-8.

    -c
    --color               Use full colors in the HTMTL outputs.

    -e PATTERN
    --exclude PATTERN     Specify a pattern for the source code files to be
                          excluded.

    -h
    --help                Print this help.

    -i PATTERN
    --include PATTERN     Specify the pattern for extra source code file names
                          to include in the HTML output. Wildcards
                          like * and [] are supported. And multiple occurances
                          of this option are allowed.

    -x
    --cross-reference     Turn on cross referencing links in the HTML output.

#### HTML output features

This `src2html.pl` script generates pretty HTML pages for each source code file
featuring

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

1. Summarized data types, macros, global variables, and functions defined in each
source code file shown as TOC at the beginning of the
corresponding HTML page.
2. Colorful syntax highlighting via the `vim` program (enabled by the `--color` option).
3. Cross-reference links to the definition lines of the referenced data types,
macros, global variables, and functions across all the source code lines
(similar to the [LXR Cross Referencer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lxr/)
but ours is much more lightweight). This is enabled by the `--cross-reference` option (or the `-x` option for short).

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Source file types recognized

Right now all the file extension names known to your `ctags` program
are supported. But `.html` and `.htm` files are always excluded to avoid
infinite recursion.

You can explicitly include extra source files by specifying as many `--include=PATTERN` options as you like,
as in

```bash
src2html.pl --include='src/*.blah' --include='*foo*' --color . "my project"
```

Similarly, you can also exclude files by specifying one or more `--exclude=PATTERN` options.

Convert the HTML site to ebooks in various formats
--------------------------------------------------

Now that we have the HTML-formatted "ebook", we can generate ebooks in other formats like `.mobi` and `.epub` using [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/).

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### Generate MOBI ebooks for Kindle

For example, to generate a `.mobi` file for Kindle DX:

```bash

cd /path/to/your/project/

# assuming we specified the "." directory while running src2html.pl
ebook-convert ./index.html my-project.mobi \
    --output-profile kindle_dx --no-inline-toc \
    --title "Your Book Title" --publisher 'Your Name' \
    --language en --authors 'Your Author Name'
```

In this example, the resulting ebook file is named `my-project.mobi` in the
current working directory.

Note: On OS X you have to go to `Preferences->Advanced->Miscellaneous` and click install command line tools to make the command line tools available after you installed the app. On other platforms, just start a terminal and type the command.

Here we use the value "kindle_dx" for the `--output-profile` option
assuming that we want to view the ebook in Kindle DX. You
should use "kindle" for other (smaller) models of Kindle.

The ebook-convert utility is provided by Calibre, see its online
documentation for full usage:

http://calibre-ebook.com/user_manual/cli/ebook-convert.html

Well you need both Perl and Python ;)

### Generate EPUB ebooks for iPad/iPhone

Below is a simple sample command to generate the `.epub` ebook from the
HTML site:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/

# assuming we specified the "." directory while running src2html.pl
ebook-convert ./index.html my-project.epub \
    --output-profile ipad3 \
    --no-default-epub-cover \
    --title "Your Book Title" --publisher 'Your Name' \
    --language en --authors 'Your Author Name'
```

In this example, the resulting ebook file is named `my-project.epub` in the
current working directory, which is readily readable in apps like `iBooks`.

Prerequisites
=============

You need to install the following dependencies of a recent version:

* [Exuberant ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/)

should be readily available in almost all the Linux
distributions by simply installing the `ctags` package.
* [vim](http://www.vim.org/)

should be readily available in almost all the Linux distributions
by simply installing the `vim` package.
* [perl 5](http://www.perl.org/)

should be readily available in almost all the Linux
distributions by simply installing the `perl` package.

All these components are very common programs in the \*NIX world.

Known issues
============

* `vim` is the dominating performance bottleneck when running the `src2html.pl`
tool with the `--color` option.
* When a tag has multiple targets, only the first one is picked up (in the future, we may provide a middle page listing all the targets for the user to choose, just as in the [LXR Cross Referencer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lxr/)).

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

TODO
====

* Add support for the `--exclude=PATTERN` options to the [src2html.pl](#src2htmlpl) tool.
